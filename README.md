# SpaceX-clone
I'm thrilled to present a project that involved recreating the SpaceX website from scratch. With careful attention to detail and a focus on user experience, I crafted each element to closely resemble the original design. Utilizing my skills in front-end development, I implemented the website using HTML CSS and JS.
